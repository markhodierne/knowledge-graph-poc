Secondary,Key Stage 4,"GCSE study in combined science provides the foundations for understanding the material world. Scientific understanding is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are both inter-linked, and are of universal application. These key ideas include:
 the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
 the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
 that change is driven by differences between different objects and systems when they interact
 that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time without direct contact
 that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
 that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry

These key ideas are relevant in different ways and with different emphases in the three subjects as part of combined science: examples of their relevance are given for each subject in the separate sections below for biology, chemistry and physics components of combined science.
GCSE specifications in combined award science should enable students to:
 develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics
 develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science, through different types of scientific enquiries that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them
 develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry and problem-solving skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other learning environments
 develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Furthermore, the sciences should be studied in ways that help students to develop curiosity about the natural world, insight into how science works, and appreciation of its relevance to their everyday lives. The scope and nature of such study should be broad, coherent, practical and satisfying, and thereby encourage students to be inspired, motivated and challenged by the subject and its achievements.","Through the content across all three disciplines, students should be taught so that they develop understanding and first-hand experience of:
1. Development of scientific thinking
• understand how scientific methods and theories develop over time
• use a variety of models such as representational, spatial, descriptive, computational and mathematical to solve problems, make predictions and to develop scientific explanations and understanding of familiar and unfamiliar facts
• appreciate the power and limitations of science and consider any ethical issues which may arise
• explain everyday and technological applications of science; evaluate associated personal, social, economic and environmental implications; and make decisions based on the evaluation of evidence and arguments
• evaluate risks both in practical science and the wider societal context, including perception of risk in relation to data and consequences
• recognise the importance of peer review of results and of communicating results to a range of audiences
2. Experimental skills and strategies
• use scientific theories and explanations to develop hypotheses
• plan experiments or devise procedures to make observations, produce or characterise a substance, test hypotheses, check data or explore phenomena
• apply a knowledge of a range of techniques, instruments, apparatus, and materials to select those appropriate to the experiment
• carry out experiments appropriately having due regard to the correct manipulation of apparatus, the accuracy of measurements and health and safety considerations
• recognise when to apply a knowledge of sampling techniques to ensure any samples collected are representative
• make and record observations and measurements using a range of apparatus and methods
• evaluate methods and suggest possible improvements and further investigations
3. Analysis and evaluation
• Apply the cycle of collecting, presenting and analysing data, including:
• presenting observations and other data using appropriate methods
• translating data from one form to another
• carrying out and represent mathematical and statistical analysis
• representing distributions of results and make estimations of uncertainty
• interpreting observations and other data (presented in verbal, diagrammatic, graphical, symbolic or numerical form), including identifying patterns and trends, making inferences and drawing conclusions
• presenting reasoned explanations including relating data to hypotheses
• being objective, evaluating data in terms of accuracy, precision, repeatability and reproducibility and identifying potential sources of random and systematic error
• communicating the scientific rationale for investigations, methods used, findings and reasoned conclusions through paper-based and electronic reports and presentations using verbal, diagrammatic, graphical, numerical and symbolic forms
4. Scientific vocabulary, quantities, units, symbols and nomenclature
• use scientific vocabulary, terminology and definitions
• recognise the importance of scientific quantities and understand how they are determined
• use SI units (e.g. kg, g, mg; km, m, mm; kJ, J) and IUPAC chemical nomenclature unless inappropriate
• use prefixes and powers of ten for orders of magnitude (e.g. tera, giga, mega, kilo, centi, milli, micro and nano)
• interconvert units

Secondary,Key Stage 4,"GCSE study in combined science provides the foundations for understanding the material world. Scientific understanding is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are both inter-linked, and are of universal application. These key ideas include:
 the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
 the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
 that change is driven by differences between different objects and systems when they interact
 that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time without direct contact
 that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
 that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry

These key ideas are relevant in different ways and with different emphases in the three subjects as part of combined science: examples of their relevance are given for each subject in the separate sections below for biology, chemistry and physics components of combined science.
GCSE specifications in combined award science should enable students to:
 develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics
 develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science, through different types of scientific enquiries that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them
 develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry and problem-solving skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other learning environments
 develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Furthermore, the sciences should be studied in ways that help students to develop curiosity about the natural world, insight into how science works, and appreciation of its relevance to their everyday lives. The scope and nature of such study should be broad, coherent, practical and satisfying, and thereby encourage students to be inspired, motivated and challenged by the subject and its achievements.","Through the content across all three disciplines, students should be taught so that they develop understanding and first-hand experience of:

Secondary,Key Stage 4,"GCSE study in combined science provides the foundations for understanding the material world. Scientific understanding is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are both inter-linked, and are of universal application. These key ideas include:
 the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
 the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
 that change is driven by differences between different objects and systems when they interact
 that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time without direct contact
 that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
 that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry

These key ideas are relevant in different ways and with different emphases in the three subjects as part of combined science: examples of their relevance are given for each subject in the separate sections below for biology, chemistry and physics components of combined science.

 develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry and problem-solving skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other learning environments
 develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

GCSE specifications in combined award science should enable students to:
 develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics
 develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science, through different types of scientific enquiries that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them
 develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry and problem-solving skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other learning environments
 develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Furthermore, the sciences should be studied in ways that help students to develop curiosity about the natural world, insight into how science works, and appreciation of its relevance to their everyday lives. The scope and nature of such study should be broad, coherent, practical and satisfying, and thereby encourage students to be inspired, motivated and challenged by the subject and its achievements.","Through the content across all three disciplines, students should be taught so that they develop understanding and first-hand experience of:

Scientific understanding is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are both inter-linked, and are of universal application. These key ideas include:
 the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
 the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
 that change is driven by differences between different objects and systems when they interact
 that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time without direct contact
 that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
 that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry

These key ideas are relevant in different ways and with different emphases in the three subjects as part of combined science: examples of their relevance are given for each subject in the separate sections below for biology, chemistry and physics components of combined science.
GCSE specifications in combined award science should enable students to:
 develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics
 develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science, through different types of scientific enquiries that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them
 develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry and problem-solving skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other learning environments
 develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Furthermore, the sciences should be studied in ways that help students to develop curiosity about the natural world, insight into how science works, and appreciation of its relevance to their everyday lives. The scope and nature of such study should be broad, coherent, practical and satisfying, and thereby encourage students to be inspired, motivated and challenged by the subject and its achievements.","Through the content across all three disciplines, students should be taught so that they develop understanding and first-hand experience of:
1. Development of scientific thinking

These key ideas include:
 the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena

Secondary,Key Stage 4,"GCSE study in combined science provides the foundations for understanding the material world. Scientific understanding is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are both inter-linked, and are of universal application. These key ideas include:
 the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
 the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
 that change is driven by differences between different objects and systems when they interact
 that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time without direct contact
 that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
 that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry

These key ideas are relevant in different ways and with different emphases in the three subjects as part of combined science: examples of their relevance are given for each subject in the separate sections below for biology, chemistry and physics components of combined science.
GCSE specifications in combined award science should enable students to:
 develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics
 develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science, through different types of scientific enquiries that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them
 develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry and problem-solving skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other learning environments
 develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Furthermore, the sciences should be studied in ways that help students to develop curiosity about the natural world, insight into how science works, and appreciation of its relevance to their everyday lives. The scope and nature of such study should be broad, coherent, practical and satisfying, and thereby encourage students to be inspired, motivated and challenged by the subject and its achievements.","Through the content across all three disciplines, students should be taught so that they develop understanding and first-hand experience of:

Secondary,Key Stage 4,"GCSE study in combined science provides the foundations for understanding the material world. Scientific understanding is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are both inter-linked, and are of universal application. These key ideas include:
 the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
 the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
 that change is driven by differences between different objects and systems when they interact
 that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time without direct contact
 that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
 that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry

These key ideas are relevant in different ways and with different emphases in the three subjects as part of combined science: examples of their relevance are given for each subject in the separate sections below for biology, chemistry and physics components of combined science.

Secondary,Key Stage 4,"GCSE study in combined science provides the foundations for understanding the material world. Scientific understanding is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are both inter-linked, and are of universal application. These key ideas include:
 the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
 the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
 that change is driven by differences between different objects and systems when they interact
 that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time without direct contact
 that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
 that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry

These key ideas are relevant in different ways and with different emphases in the three subjects as part of combined science: examples of their relevance are given for each subject in the separate sections below for biology, chemistry and physics components of combined science.
GCSE specifications in combined award science should enable students to:
 develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics
 develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science, through different types of scientific enquiries that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them
 develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry and problem-solving skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other learning environments
 develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Furthermore, the sciences should be studied in ways that help students to develop curiosity about the natural world, insight into how science works, and appreciation of its relevance to their everyday lives.

Secondary,Key Stage 4,"GCSE study in combined science provides the foundations for understanding the material world. Scientific understanding is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are both inter-linked, and are of universal application. These key ideas include:
 the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
 the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
 that change is driven by differences between different objects and systems when they interact
 that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time without direct contact
 that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
 that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry

Secondary,Key Stage 4,"GCSE study in combined science provides the foundations for understanding the material world. Scientific understanding is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a small number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are both inter-linked, and are of universal application. These key ideas include:
 the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
 the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
 that change is driven by differences between different objects and systems when they interact
 that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time without direct contact
 that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
 that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry

These key ideas are relevant in different ways and with different emphases in the three subjects as part of combined science: examples of their relevance are given for each subject in the separate sections below for biology, chemistry and physics components of combined science.
GCSE specifications in combined award science should enable students to:
 develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics
 develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science, through different types of scientific enquiries that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them
 develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry and problem-solving skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other learning environments
 develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Furthermore, the sciences should be studied in ways that help students to develop curiosity about the natural world, insight into how science works, and appreciation of its relevance to their everyday lives. The scope and nature of such study should be broad, coherent, practical and satisfying, and thereby encourage students to be inspired, motivated and challenged by the subject and its achievements.","Through the content across all three disciplines, students should be taught so that they develop understanding and first-hand experience of:
1. Development of scientific thinking

• appreciate the power and limitations of science and consider any ethical issues which may arise
• explain everyday and technological applications of science; evaluate associated personal, social, economic and environmental implications; and make decisions based on the evaluation of evidence and arguments
• evaluate risks both in practical science and the wider societal context, including perception of risk in relation to data and consequences
• recognise the importance of peer review of results and of communicating results to a range of audiences
2. Experimental skills and strategies
• use scientific theories and explanations to develop hypotheses
• plan experiments or devise procedures to make observations, produce or characterise a substance, test hypotheses, check data or explore phenomena
• apply a knowledge of a range of techniques, instruments, apparatus, and materials to select those appropriate to the experiment
• carry out experiments appropriately having due regard to the correct manipulation of apparatus, the accuracy of measurements and health and safety considerations
• recognise when to apply a knowledge of sampling techniques to ensure any samples collected are representative
• make and record observations and measurements using a range of apparatus and methods
• evaluate methods and suggest possible improvements and further investigations
3. Analysis and evaluation
• Apply the cycle of collecting, presenting and analysing data, including:
• presenting observations and other data using appropriate methods
• translating data from one form to another
• carrying out and represent mathematical and statistical analysis
• representing distributions of results and make estimations of uncertainty
• interpreting observations and other data (presented in verbal, diagrammatic, graphical, symbolic or numerical form), including identifying patterns and trends, making inferences and drawing conclusions
• presenting reasoned explanations including relating data to hypotheses
• being objective, evaluating data in terms of accuracy, precision, repeatability and reproducibility and identifying potential sources of random and systematic error
• communicating the scientific rationale for investigations, methods used, findings and reasoned conclusions through paper-based and electronic reports and presentations using verbal, diagrammatic, graphical, numerical and symbolic forms
4. Scientific vocabulary, quantities, units, symbols and nomenclature
• use scientific vocabulary, terminology and definitions
• recognise the importance of scientific quantities and understand how they are determined
• use SI units (e.g. kg, g, mg; km, m, mm; kJ, J) and IUPAC chemical nomenclature unless inappropriate
• use prefixes and powers of ten for orders of magnitude (e.g. tera, giga, mega, kilo, centi, milli, micro and nano)

• the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
• the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
• that change is driven by interactions between different objects and systems
• that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time
• that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
• that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry.

The sciences should be taught in ways that ensure students have the knowledge to enable them to develop curiosity about the natural world, insight into working scientifically, and appreciation of the relevance of science to their everyday lives, so that students:
• develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics;
• develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science, through different types of scientific enquiry that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them;
• develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry, problem-solving skills and mathematical skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other environments;
• develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Science is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate the achievements of science in showing how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are inter-linked, and which are of universal application. These key ideas include:
• the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
• the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
• that change is driven by interactions between different objects and systems
• that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time
• that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
• that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry.

For some students, studying the sciences in key stage 4 provides the platform for more advanced studies, establishing the basis for a wide range of careers. For others, it will be their last formal study of subjects that provide the foundations for understanding the natural world and will enhance their lives in an increasingly technological society.
Science is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate the achievements of science in showing how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are inter-linked, and which are of universal application. These key ideas include:
• the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
• the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
• that change is driven by interactions between different objects and systems
• that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time
• that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
• that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry.

The sciences should be taught in ways that ensure students have the knowledge to enable them to develop curiosity about the natural world, insight into working scientifically, and appreciation of the relevance of science to their everyday lives, so that students:
• develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics;
• develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science, through different types of scientific enquiry that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them;
• develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry, problem-solving skills and mathematical skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other environments;
• develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

For others, it will be their last formal study of subjects that provide the foundations for understanding the natural world and will enhance their lives in an increasingly technological society.
Science is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate the achievements of science in showing how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are inter-linked, and which are of universal application. These key ideas include:
• the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
• the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
• that change is driven by interactions between different objects and systems
• that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time
• that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
• that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry.

• develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics;
• develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science, through different types of scientific enquiry that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them;

Science is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science.

These key ideas include:
• the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
• the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
• that change is driven by interactions between different objects and systems
• that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time
• that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
• that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry.

Science is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate the achievements of science in showing how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are inter-linked, and which are of universal application. These key ideas include:
• the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
• the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
• that change is driven by interactions between different objects and systems
• that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time
• that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
• that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry.

The sciences should be taught in ways that ensure students have the knowledge to enable them to develop curiosity about the natural world, insight into working scientifically, and appreciation of the relevance of science to their everyday lives, so that students:
• develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics;
• develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science, through different types of scientific enquiry that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them;
• develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry, problem-solving skills and mathematical skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other environments;
• develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Science is changing our lives and is vital to the world’s future prosperity, and all students should be taught essential aspects of the knowledge, methods, processes and uses of science. They should be helped to appreciate the achievements of science in showing how the complex and diverse phenomena of the natural world can be described in terms of a number of key ideas relating to the sciences which are inter-linked, and which are of universal application. These key ideas include:
• the use of conceptual models and theories to make sense of the observed diversity of natural phenomena
• the assumption that every effect has one or more cause
• that change is driven by interactions between different objects and systems
• that many such interactions occur over a distance and over time
• that science progresses through a cycle of hypothesis, practical experimentation, observation, theory development and review
• that quantitative analysis is a central element both of many theories and of scientific methods of inquiry.

The sciences should be taught in ways that ensure students have the knowledge to enable them to develop curiosity about the natural world, insight into working scientifically, and appreciation of the relevance of science to their everyday lives, so that students:
• develop scientific knowledge and conceptual understanding through the specific disciplines of biology, chemistry and physics;
• develop understanding of the nature, processes and methods of science, through different types of scientific enquiry that help them to answer scientific questions about the world around them;
• develop and learn to apply observational, practical, modelling, enquiry, problem-solving skills and mathematical skills, both in the laboratory, in the field and in other environments;
• develop their ability to evaluate claims based on science through critical analysis of the methodology, evidence and conclusions, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Curricula at key stage 4 should comprise approximately equal proportions of biology, chemistry and physics. The relevant mathematical skills required are covered in the programme of study for mathematics and should be embedded in the science context.
‘Working scientifically’ is described separately at the beginning of the programme of study, but must always be taught through and clearly related to substantive science content in the programme of study. Teachers should feel free to choose examples that serve a variety of purposes, from showing how scientific ideas have developed historically to reflecting modern developments in science and informing students of the role of science in understanding the causes of and solutions to some of the challenges facing society.
The scope and nature of their study should be broad, coherent, practical and rigorous, so that students are inspired and challenged by the subject and its achievements.","Through the content across all three disciplines, students should be taught so that they develop understanding and first-hand experience of:

Teachers should feel free to choose examples that serve a variety of purposes, from showing how scientific ideas have developed historically to reflecting modern developments in science and informing students of the role of science in understanding the causes of and solutions to some of the challenges facing society.
The scope and nature of their study should be broad, coherent, practical and rigorous, so that students are inspired and challenged by the subject and its achievements.","Through the content across all three disciplines, students should be taught so that they develop understanding and first-hand experience of:
1. The development of scientific thinking
• the ways in which scientific methods and theories develop over time
• using a variety of concepts and models to develop scientific explanations and understanding
• appreciating the power and limitations of science and considering ethical issues which may arise
• explaining everyday and technological applications of science; evaluating associated personal, social, economic and environmental implications; and making decisions based on the evaluation of evidence and arguments
• evaluating risks both in practical science and the wider societal context, including perception of risk
• recognising the importance of peer review of results and of communication of results to a range of audiences.
2. Experimental skills and strategies
• using scientific theories and explanations to develop hypotheses
• planning experiments to make observations, test hypotheses or explore phenomena
• applying a knowledge of a range of techniques, apparatus, and materials to select those appropriate both for fieldwork and for experiments
• carrying out experiments appropriately, having due regard to the correct manipulation of apparatus, the accuracy of measurements and health and safety considerations
• recognising when to apply a knowledge of sampling techniques to ensure any samples collected are representative
• making and recording observations and measurements using a range of apparatus and methods
• evaluating methods and suggesting possible improvements and further investigations.
3. Analysis and evaluation
• applying the cycle of collecting, presenting and analysing data, including:
• presenting observations and other data using appropriate methods
• translating data from one form to another
• carrying out and representing mathematical and statistical analysis
• representing distributions of results and making estimations of uncertainty
• interpreting observations and other data, including identifying patterns and trends, making inferences and drawing conclusions
• presenting reasoned explanations, including relating data to hypotheses
• being objective, evaluating data in terms of accuracy, precision, repeatability and reproducibility and identifying potential sources of random and systematic error
• communicating the scientific rationale for investigations, including the methods used, the findings and reasoned conclusions, using paper-based and electronic reports and presentations.
4. Vocabulary, units, symbols and nomenclature
• developing their use of scientific vocabulary and nomenclature
• recognising the importance of scientific quantities and understanding how they are determined
• using SI units and IUPAC chemical nomenclature unless inappropriate
• using prefixes and powers of ten for orders of magnitude (e.g. tera, giga, mega, kilo, centi, milli, micro and nano)
• interconverting units
• using an appropriate number of significant figures in calculations.",,Physics,Year 11,Space physics,• the main features of the solar system.,,479,Gravity in space

They could research unfamiliar animals and plants from a broad range of other habitats and decide where they belong in the classification system.",215,Why we group and classify living things
Primary,Key Stage 2,"The principal focus of science teaching in upper key stage 2 is to enable pupils to develop a deeper understanding of a wide range of scientific ideas. They should do this through exploring and talking about their ideas; asking their own questions about scientific phenomena; and analysing functions, relationships and interactions more systematically. At upper key stage 2, they should encounter more abstract ideas and begin to recognise how these ideas help them to understand and predict how the world operates. They should also begin to recognise that scientific ideas change and develop over time. They should select the most appropriate ways to answer science questions using different types of scientific enquiry, including observing changes over different periods of time, noticing patterns, grouping and classifying things, carrying out comparative and fair tests and finding things out using a wide range of secondary sources of information. Pupils should draw conclusions based on their data and observations, use evidence to justify their ideas, and use their scientific knowledge and understanding to explain their findings.
‘Working and thinking scientifically’ is described separately at the beginning of the programme of study, but must always be taught through and clearly related to substantive science content in the programme of study. Throughout the notes and guidance, examples show how scientific methods and skills might be linked to specific elements of the content.
Pupils should read, spell and pronounce scientific vocabulary correctly.","During years 5 and 6, pupils should be taught to use the following practical scientific methods, processes and skills through the teaching of the programme of study content:
 planning different types of scientific enquiries to answer questions, including recognising and controlling variables where necessary
 taking measurements, using a range of scientific equipment, with increasing accuracy and precision, taking repeat readings when appropriate
 recording data and results of increasing complexity using scientific diagrams and labels, classification keys, tables, scatter graphs, bar and line graphs
 using test results to make predictions to set up further comparative and fair tests
 reporting and presenting findings from enquiries, including conclusions, causal relationships and explanations of and degree of trust in results, in oral and written forms such as displays and other presentations
 identifying scientific evidence that has been used to support or refute ideas or arguments.","Pupils in years 5 and 6 should use their science experiences to: explore ideas and raise different kinds of questions; select and plan the most appropriate type of scientific enquiry to use to answer scientific questions; recognise when and how to set up comparative and fair tests and explain which variables need to be controlled and why. They should use and develop keys and other information records to identify, classify and describe living things and materials, and identify patterns that might be found in the natural environment. They should make their own decisions about what observations to make, what measurements to use and how long to make them for, and whether to repeat them; choose the most appropriate equipment to make measurements and explain how to use it accurately. They should decide how to record data from a choice of familiar approaches; look for different causal relationships in their data and identify evidence that refutes or supports their ideas. They should use their results to identify when further tests and observations might be needed; recognise which secondary sources will be most useful to research their ideas and begin to separate opinion from fact.

 compare and give reasons for variations in how components function, including the brightness of bulbs, the loudness of buzzers and the on/off position of switches
 use recognised symbols when representing a simple circuit in a diagram.","Building on their work in year 4, pupils should construct simple series circuits, to help them to answer questions about what happens when they try different components, for example, switches, bulbs, buzzers and motors. They should learn how to represent a simple circuit in a diagram using recognised symbols.
Note: Pupils are expected to learn only about series circuits, not parallel circuits. Pupils should be taught to take the necessary precautions for working safely with electricity.
Pupils might work scientifically by: systematically identifying the effect of changing one component at a time in a circuit; designing and making a set of traffic lights, a burglar alarm or some other useful circuit.",216,Changing circuits
