Next Unit: N/A

In this unit, the thread concludes as pupils evaluate the complex interplay of political and social factors delaying women's suffrage in Britain. They assess how peaceful and radical tactics, figures like Millicent Fawcett and Emmeline Pankhurst, and events like the Great War impacted political change. Pupils apply this to understand the evolving role of women in shaping political power structures and the eventual legislative changes granting them the vote."
